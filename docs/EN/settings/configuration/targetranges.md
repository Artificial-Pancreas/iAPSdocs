# Target Ranges
!!! abstract "Highlights"
    - Set your lower target between 5-6 mmol/L

This allows you to set your target blood sugar range. Note that by default, iAPS (and OpenAPS) ignore your higher value unless "Wide BG Target Range" is enabled in preferences. In other words, if your range is set at 5-5.5 mmol/L, iAPS treats it as 5-5 mmol/L.

Generally, a low target between 5-6 mmol/L is set by most users, or 1.5 mmol/L points above where they start feeling a low.
