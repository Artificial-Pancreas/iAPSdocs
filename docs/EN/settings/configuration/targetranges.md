- Set your target glucose to your ideal blood glucose value.
:::
iAPS no longer utilizes a target range of blood sugars. It uses a single blood glucose target in its dosing calculations.

Users often set this value between 90-110 mg/dL or 5.0-6.0 mmol/L.

Important Note: Setting this value too low or too high can cause out-of-range blood sugars.
